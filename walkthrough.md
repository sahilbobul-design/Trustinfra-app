# BharatChain Lang - Real-time Blockchain Auditing

The BharatChain system is now fully operational with a custom DSL interpreter that simulates real-time blockchain auditing for Indian contractors.

## 🚀 Accomplishments
- **Premium Frontend Overhaul**: Replicated the "Lovable" aesthetic using Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and a professional sidebar-based layout.
- **BharatChain Lang Runtime**: A custom interpreter that parses complex DSL commands for contracts, work registration, and sensor data.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time metrics for Wallet balance (INR), Gas spent, and Blockchain block verification.
- **Integrated Terminal**: A high-end auditor shell built directly into the dashboard for real-time BharatChain Lang execution.
- **Blockchain Core**: Robust SHA256-based blockchain with Indian Transaction ID generation (`IND-<timestamp>-<hash>`).


## 🛠️ How to Run
To see the full simulation in action, run:
```powershell
node run-bharatchain.js
```

## 📋 DSL Commands Supported
- `CONTRACT <id>`
- `CONTRACTOR <name>`
- `REGISTER_WORK <work_name> <quantity>`
- `SENSOR_DATA <moisture> <ultrasonic> <temperature>`
- `HASH_DETAIL <key> <value>` (Generates tamper-proof hashes)
- `VALIDATE`
- `GENERATE_TX`
- `CALCULATE_GAS <value_in_inr>`
- `DISPLAY` (Triggers the visual terminal output)

## ✅ Verification Results
The system was verified with a 100+ line DSL script covering multiple contracts and sensor readings.
- **Final Wallet Balance**: Managed accurately after transaction fees and payments.
- **Transaction Integrity**: Verified matching of Indian TX IDs and block hashes.
